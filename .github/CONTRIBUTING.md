## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you've read
the available [Documentation](https://the-firehub-project.github.io/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing questions in the discussion that might help you.
In case you've found a suitable question and still need clarification, you can write your question in this discussion.
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a discussion in [Q&A](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions/categories/q-a).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report.
Complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you're using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side, for example, using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you've read the [documentation](https://the-firehub-project.github.io/)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you're having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker.
- Also, make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You should never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs, including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to danijel.galic@outlook.com.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an issue. (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.
  This usually includes your code.
  For good bug reports, you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it is filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps.
  If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `status: Feedback Needed`.
  Bugs with the `status: Feedback Needed` tag will not be addressed until they're reproduced.

## Reporting Incidents

If any of our software exhibits questionable behavior, and at that point you aren't sure if it is a bug or not, report it to [Incident](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions/categories/incident) discussion.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the discussion to identify the incident.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the incident** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
  At this point, you can also tell which alternatives don't work for you.

## Suggesting Enhancements or Ideas

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement or idea suggestion for FireHub, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement or Idea

- Make sure that you're using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://the-firehub-project.github.io/) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a search to see if the enhancement or idea has already been suggested.
  If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
  It is up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
  Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not a small subset.
  If you're targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement or Idea Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked in [Suggestions](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions/categories/suggestions) discussion and ideas are tracked in [Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions/categories/ideas) discussion.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the discussion to identify the suggestion or idea.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
  At this point, you can also tell which alternatives don't work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most FireHub users.
  You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[danijel.galic@outlook.com](mailto:danijel.galic@outlook.com)**.
