The security of our users is a top priority. This document explains how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities and how we handle them.

This security policy applies to **all FireHub repositories**, including:

- Core framework (Foundation, Professional, Enterprise)
- Adapters (HTTP, Console, etc.)
- Capability modules (firehub-*-capability)
- Adapter-specific modules (firehub-*-module)
- Meta-repositories, templates, and infrastructure tools

## Supported Versions

FireHub frameworks, adapters, capabilities, and modules follow a clear support lifecycle.  
Check the detailed supported versions, timelines, and maintenance policy here:

> This document includes support for Core Foundation, Professional, Enterprise, as well as all adapters, capabilities, and modules.  
> Keep it handy to ensure your projects run on supported releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any suspected security vulnerability **privately** via email:

**Guidelines:**

1. Include a **descriptive title** of the vulnerability.
2. Provide a **detailed description** and any reproduction steps.
3. Include version numbers, platform, and any relevant logs or code snippets.
4. Do **not disclose the issue publicly** until a patch is released.

We aim to respond to all security reports within **48 hours**.

## Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** You will receive a confirmation email within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment:** We verify the vulnerability and determine the severity.
3. **Patch:** Critical vulnerabilities are patched as quickly as possible.
4. **Disclosure:** Once fixed, we coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter.

We appreciate your help in keeping FireHub safe.
