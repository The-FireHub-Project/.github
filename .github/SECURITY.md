# Security Policy for The FireHub Project

The security of our users is a top priority. This document explains how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities and how we handle them.

This security policy applies to **all FireHub repositories**, including:

- Core framework (Standard, Professional, Enterprise)
- Adapters (HTTP, Console, etc.)
- Capability modules (firehub-*-capability)
- Adapter-specific modules (firehub-*-module)
- Meta-repositories, templates, and infrastructure tools

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and patch the following FireHub versions:

| Version | Status      | Supported Until                    |
|---------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| < 1.0   | Active      | Not supported while in development |

If you are using an unsupported version, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any suspected security vulnerability **privately** via email:

**Email:** [danijel.galic@outlook.com](mailto:danijel.galic@outlook.com)

**Guidelines:**

1. Include a **descriptive title** of the vulnerability.
2. Provide a **detailed description** and any reproduction steps.
3. Include version numbers, platform, and any relevant logs or code snippets.
4. Do **not disclose the issue publicly** until a patch is released.

We aim to respond to all security reports within **48 hours**.

## Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** You will receive a confirmation email within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment:** We verify the vulnerability and determine the severity.
