# Support FireHub

Thank you for using **FireHub**! This guide explains how to get help, report issues, and contribute effectively to the project. Following these guidelines ensures your requests are addressed efficiently and your contributions have maximum impact.

## Documentation

Before asking for help, please consult our [documentation](https://the-firehub-project.github.io/).  
The docs cover common use cases and can answer many questions without needing to open an issue.  
You can also contribute to the documentation by submitting PRs to [the-firehub-project.github.io](https://github.com/The-FireHub-Project/the-firehub-project.github.io).

## GitHub

For code-related issues and debugging, we recommend using GitHub:

- **Issues:** [FireHub Issues](https://github.com/The-FireHub-Project/Core-Foundation/issues) – For most bugs and framework issues.
- **Discussions:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions) – For questions, feedback, and suggestions. Feel free to create a new discussion if needed.

### How to Ask for Help

1. Search existing issues and discussions first – your problem may already have been addressed.
2. If not, create a new issue or discussion with:
  - A **descriptive title**
  - A **step-by-step description** of the problem
  - Any **debug output, code snippets, or environment details**

Remember: The clearer your explanation, the faster we can help.

### How We Prioritize Issues

We aim to address issues based on:

1. How many users are affected?
2. Whether a workaround exists
3. How consistently the issue occurs

This helps us focus on work with the highest impact.

### If Your Issue Goes Stale

Sometimes issues may not receive immediate attention. Common reasons and strategies:

- **Gentle Reminder:** Ping maintainers politely (e.g., `@username any thoughts?`).
- **Unclear Issue:** Provide detailed reproduction steps and context.
- **Low Impact:** Consider submitting a suggested fix or improvement yourself.
- **Duplicated Issues:** Search for duplicates and consolidate discussions to help focus efforts.
- **Scope:** Frame issues in the context of the overall project or related components for clarity.
- **Milestones:** Add your issue to a [GitHub milestone](https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/) if relevant.

### Contributing Helps Everyone

Even if you cannot code, you can support FireHub by:

- Reporting bugs clearly and promptly
- Suggesting enhancements or new features
- Improving documentation
- Sharing FireHub with your community

Your contributions, feedback, and patience help FireHub grow and improve. Thank you!
